I'm a 22 year old graduate student at Columbia University in the city of New York, pursuing a [MSc in Business Analytics](https://msba.engineering.columbia.edu/) jointly offered by Columbia Engineering & Columbia Business School.

For the past few years, I have worked on multiple data-driven internships across numerous industries - from Financial Services to Manufacturing and EdTech! I have also been involved in Computer Vision research, pro-bono technical consultancy projects, hackathons and much more.

Outside work, I love watching and playing football, reading books, and generally exploring new cuisines.
