I’m an engineer and strategist based in New York, focused on designing and deploying data-driven systems that operate under real-world constraints.

I currently work at Palantir, partnering with operators and engineers to bring analytical and AI-driven workflows from concept to production. My work sits at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and domain understanding, translating ambiguous problems into clear models, decision systems, and tools that people trust and use.

This site is a living record of the systems/applications I build, the ideas I explore, and the problems I care about.
