I’m an engineer and strategist based in New York, focused on designing and shipping data-driven systems that operate under real constraints.

I currently work at Palantir, where I partner directly with operators and engineers to deploy end-to-end analytical and optimization workflows into production environments. My work sits at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and domain understanding—translating messy, ambiguous problems into explicit models, decision systems, and tools that people actually use.

Before Palantir, I worked as a data scientist across Financial Services, Manufacturing, and EdTech, building predictive models, optimization frameworks, and applied machine learning systems. That background shapes how I approach problems today: start from first principles, make assumptions explicit, and design systems that scale beyond demos.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching and playing football, reading, and exploring new cuisines.
