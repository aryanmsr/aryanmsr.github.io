I'm a 23 year old Data Scientist living in New York.

I currently work as a Data Scientist at Prudential Financial, where I leverage mathematical modeling and machine learning to help drive business decisions across the Sales & Distribution team. Previously, I worked on multiple data-driven internships across numerous industries - from Financial Services to Manufacturing and EdTech! I have also been involved in Computer Vision research, pro-bono technical consultancy projects, hackathons and much more.

Outside work, I love watching and playing football, reading books, and generally exploring new cuisines.
