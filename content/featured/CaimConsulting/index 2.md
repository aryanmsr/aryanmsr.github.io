Collaborated alongside a team of four to build a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a basketball game using past statistical data. Performed comprehensive background research on sports and basketball literature for feature engineering, along with data preprocessing, wrangling, analysis and visualization.

Subsequently modeled the data under multiple binary classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, achieving a final accuracy of approximately 70% - higher than most sports prediction models.
