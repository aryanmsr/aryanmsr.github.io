I built a prototype ML-based score-predictor feature for the startup [Focus Project](http://focusproject.es/) using a dataset that included attributes such as past student grades, demographic, social, and school related factors.

After performing some basic visualisations, data pre-processing and feature engineering, I modelled the data under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks to predict the students' final scores.
