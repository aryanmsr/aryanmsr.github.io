HyperLang AI is a language learning app I am currently building that leverages LLMs and TTS models to generate personalized dialogues with realistic audio output. The project simulates multilingual conversations between AI agents, complete with accents, cultural references, and explanations. I created this with my friend as an alternative to traditional language learning apps to provide a more immersive, podcast-style learning experience (and to aid in my own language learning journey).
