MealPlan is part of a broader Lifestyle Recommendation system I built (mainly for myself). As of now, it is a Python-based system designed to provide personalized diet recommendations. Utilizing a combination of nutritional science, user preferences and content-based filtering, this tool aims to assist users in planning their meals effectively to meet their dietary goals.
