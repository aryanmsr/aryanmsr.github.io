The goal of this project was to use macroeconomic data to identify and predict different market regimes. Regimes are characterized by varying statistical properties and are driven by the non-stationarity of the financial markets, creating the need to effectively detect and categorize different market regimes to optimize portfolio returns.

For this project, I researched and implemented a Hidden Markov model and created a module that automatically extracted 700+ macroeconomic indicators from OECD, FRED, & World Bank and identfied the present and future regimes, along with the drivers behind those regimes.
