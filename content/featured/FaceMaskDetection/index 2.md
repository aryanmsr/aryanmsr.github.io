The goal of this project was to use macroeconomic data to identify, understand, and predict different market regimes. Regimes are characterized by varying statistical properties and are driven by the non-stationarity of the financial markets. This creates the need to effectively detect and categorize different market regimes so quantitative traders can optimize their strategy selection and improve their portfolio returns.

For this project, I researched and implemented a Hidden Markov model and created a module that automatically extracted 700+ macroeconomic indicators from OECD, FRED, & World Bank and identfied the present and future regimes, along with the drivers behind those regimes.
