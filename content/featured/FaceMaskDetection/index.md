The overall purpose of this project was to create a complete and clean dataset that would later be used to perform Econometric analysis on for my undergraduate [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12O0pSfLe5M7m73ix6uk5TLUgcQOVHulS/view).

I extracted Twitter data from 10 different cricket leagues' Twitter accounts using the Python [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) library. I also performed some basic sentiment analysis using Textblob to obtain polarity and subjectivity scores from the relevant tweets.
