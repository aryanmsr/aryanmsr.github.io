This project is part of my graduate Machine Learning course where I applied User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF) for streaming recommendations. The dataset used is a subset of the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. Basic EDA was performed, followed by model fitting, prediction, and evaluation.

This was a great project since it introduced me to the world of recommendation systems, which truly are a fascinating subclass of machine learning in general.
