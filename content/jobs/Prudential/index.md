- Developed a custom Next Best Action (NBA) model based on LSTM neural networks to recommend optimal actions for Prudential advisors during client interactions, resulting in a 59% lift in conversion rate and 17% lift in AOI.
- Analyzed and preprocessed +2M data points for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and subsequent model building using the Python data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, statsmodels).
- Collaborated with data scientists and senior product managers to define key metrics and measurement frameworks for the NBA model to ensure a consistent evaluation structure.
