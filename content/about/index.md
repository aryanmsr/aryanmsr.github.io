I come from a very multi-cultural background, spanning Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Specifically, I grew up and lived across Nepal, India, Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia, and Italy. Today, I'm blessed to call New York city my home, where I'm currently enrolled as a graduate student at Columbia University.

Before Columbia, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Economics, Management, and Computer Science from Bocconi University, Milan. Throughout my time at Bocconi, I realized that my favourite experiences were working at the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics to explain key strategic implications. As a result, my interest in Data Science and Analytics was born.

Since then, I have worked on multiple DS and ML related projects. Here is a list of the technologies that I haved worked with so far!
