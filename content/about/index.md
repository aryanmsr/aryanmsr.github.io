I come from a very multi-cultural background, spanning Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Specifically, I grew up and lived across Nepal, India, Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia, and Italy. Today, I'm blessed to call New York city my home, where I'm currently employed as a Data Scientist at Prudential Financial - a Fortune 100 company.

Before Prudential, I graduated with a Master of Science in Business Analytics from Columbia Engineering & Columbia Business School. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Economics, and Computer Science from Bocconi University, Milan. Throughout my education, I realized that my favourite experiences were working at the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics to explain key strategic implications. As a result, my interest in Data Science and Analytics was born.

Since then, I have worked on multiple DS and ML related projects. Here is a list of the technologies that I haved applied in my projects so far!
