I come from a multicultural background shaped by living across Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Moving between very different environments early on taught me how systems, social, economic, and technical, behave differently under varying constraints, resources, and incentives.

I currently work at Palantir as a Deployment Strategist, where I help design and deploy data-driven systems into real operational environments. In this role, I lead problem framing with stakeholders, translate ambiguous and high-stakes challenges into explicit analytical and optimization models, and partner closely with fellow engineers to deliver systems that can be implemented, scaled, and trusted. This work builds on my data science background while pushing me to think beyond models in isolation and toward end-to-end system design, adoption, and value creation.

My academic training sits at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and economics. I earned a Master of Science from Columbia Engineering and Columbia Business School, following a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Computer Science from Bocconi University in Milan. During my studies, I became particularly interested in how formal models, whether predictive or optimization-based, can support better decision-making in complex, real-world settings.

Across my education and career, I have worked on projects spanning predictive modeling, machine learning, optimization, and applied AI. What ties these experiences together is a focus on clarity: making assumptions explicit, understanding trade-offs, and building systems that continue to perform when theory meets real operational constraints.
